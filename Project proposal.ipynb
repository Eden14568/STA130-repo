    "Analysis 1: Correlation Between Self-Esteem and Interpersonal Attachment Styles\n",
    "1. Research Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a significant correlation between self-esteem levels and interpersonal attachment styles?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Understanding the relationship between self-esteem and interpersonal relationships can provide insights for psychological research and potential suggestions for improving interpersonal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Esteem: Measured using self-perception scales.\n",
    "Interpersonal Attachment Style: Assessed using the Attachment Style Questionnaire, which categorizes individuals into Secure, Anxious, or Avoidant.\n",

    "4. Visualization Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter Plot: Illustrates the relationship between self-esteem and attachment styles.\n",
    "Frequency Distribution: Displays the distribution of self-esteem levels and attachment styles.\n",

    "5. Analysis Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Analysis: Using Spearman rank correlation coefficient to evaluate the relationship between ordinal data (self-esteem and attachment styles).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): No correlation exists between self-esteem and attachment style.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): A significant correlation exists between self-esteem and attachment style.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Expected Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Higher self-esteem correlates with a more secure attachment style, suggesting a positive relationship.\n",
    "Implications: Supporting this hypothesis would offer valuable insights for psychological research, while contrary results might prompt exploration of other factors, like social skills and emotional intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Data Analysis Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cleaning: Remove missing values and outliers.\n",
    "Data Visualization: Create scatterplots and frequency distributions for self-esteem and attachment styles.\n",
    "Statistical Analysis: Calculate Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient to test the hypotheses."
